Aldor is a programming language. It is the successor of A# as the extension language of the Axiom computer algebra system.

The Aldor language combines imperative, functional, and object-oriented features. It has an elaborate type system, allowing types to be used as first-class values. Aldor's syntax is heavily influenced by Pascal, but it is optionally indentation-sensitive, like Python. In its current implementation, it is compiled, but an interactive listener is provided.

== Examples ==

The Hello world program looks like this:

#include "aldor"
#include "aldorio"

stdout << "Hello, world!" << newline;

;99 Bottles of Beer

#include "aldor"
#include "aldorio"

import from Integer, String;

bob(n: Integer): String == {
    b: String := " bottle";

if n ~= 1 then b := b + "s";
    b + " of beer";
}

main(): () == {
    n: Integer := 99;
    otw: String := " on the wall";

-- refrain
    while n > 0 repeat {
        stdout << n << bob(n) << otw << ", " << n << bob(n) << "." << newline;
        stdout << "Take one down and pass it around, ";
        n := n - 1;
        if n > 0 then stdout << n;
        else stdout << "no more";
        stdout << bob(n) << otw << "." << newline;
        stdout << newline;
    }

-- last verse
    stdout << "No more" << bob(n) << otw << ", no more" << bob(n) << "." << newline;
    stdout << "Go to the store and buy some more, ";
    n: Integer := 99;
    stdout << n << bob(n) << otw << "." << newline;
}

main();
