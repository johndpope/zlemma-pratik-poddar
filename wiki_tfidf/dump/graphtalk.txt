==History==
CSC was founded in April 1959 by Roy Nutt, Fletcher Jones and Bob Patrick. Their goal then was to provide programming tools such as assemblers and compilers. Jones, who ran the business and marketing, obtained a contract from Honeywell that made the business profitable and respected within the industry. Although its competitor Computer Usage Company had been founded earlier in 1955, by 1963 CSC became the largest software company in the United States and took the business public with an IPO listed on the American Stock Exchange. By the end of 1968, CSC was listed on the New York Stock Exchange and had operations in Canada, India, the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, Italy, Brazil, and the Netherlands.

Since its beginnings in 1959, company headquarters had been in California.  On  March 29, 2008, the corporate headquarters of the Company were relocated from El Segundo to Annandale, Virginia.

CSC has been a Fortune 500 Company since 1995, coming in at 162 in the 2012 rankings.

==Business==
CSC employs about 98,000 employees (as of March 30, 2012) in 90 countries and ranks among the largest outsourcing companies in the world.
