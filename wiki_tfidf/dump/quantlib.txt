QuantLib is an open-source software library which provides tools for software developers interested in financial instrument valuation and related subjects. QuantLib is written in C++.

==History==
The QuantLib project was started by a few quantitative analysts who worked at RiskMap (currently StatPro Italia).  The first e-mail announcing QuantLib to the world was sent on December 11th, 2000, and signed by Ferdinando Ametrano, Luigi Ballabio and Marco Marchioro. RiskMap  was founded by Dario Cintioli, previously Head of Interest Rate Derivatives & Quants, Ferdinando (Nando) Ametrano, Luigi Ballabio, Adolfo Benin, and Marco Marchioro. The people at RiskMap faced the problem, not for the first time in their life, to build a financial library from scratch. It was Nando's idea to build an open source library that could be used by quants all over the world when starting to build a new quantitative library.  However, it was Dario's courage and vision that firstly financed QuantLib's development and made it into a reality. Currently, the QuantLib project is headed by Luigi Ballabio and Ferdinando (Nando) Ametrano.
