The automotive industry is a term that covers a wide range of companies and organizations involved in the design, development, manufacture, marketing, and selling of motor vehicles, towed vehicles, motorcycles and mopeds. It is one of the world's most important economic sectors by revenue.

The term automotive industry usually does not include industries dedicated to the maintenance of automobiles following delivery to the end-user, such as repair shops and motor fuel filling stations.

The term automotive was created from Greek autos (self), and Latin motivus (of motion) to represent any form of self-powered vehicle. This term was proposed by SAE member Elmer Sperry.

==History==

The automotive industry began in the 1890s with hundreds of manufacturers that pioneered the horseless carriage. For many decades, the United States led the world in total automobile production. In 1929 before the Great Depression, the world had 32,028,500 automobiles in use, and the U.S. automobile industry produced over 90% of them. At that time the U.S. had one car per 4.87 persons. After World War II, the U.S. produced about 75 percent of world's auto production. In 1980, the U.S. was overtaken by Japan and became world's leader again in 1994. In 2006, Japan narrowly passed the U.S. in production and held this rank until 2009, when China took the top spot with 13.8 million units. With 19.3 million units manufactured in 2012, China almost doubled the U.S. production, with 10.3 million units, while Japan was in third place with 9.9 million units.

==Safety==

Safety is a state that implies to be protected from any risk, danger, damage or cause of injury. In the automotive industry, safety means that users, operators or manufacturers do not face any risk or danger coming from the motor vehicle or its spare parts. Safety for the automotives themselves implies that there is no risk of damage.

Safety in the automotive industry is particularly important and therefore highly regulated. Automobiles and other motor vehicles have to comply with a certain number of norms and regulations, whether local or international, in order to be accepted on the market. The standard ISO 26262  (_See also main article:_ ISO 26262) for instance is considered as one of the best practice framework for achieving automotive functional safety. That is, to ensure that motored vehicles meet all requirements for safe manufacturing and operation for end-users.

In case of safety issues, danger, product defect or faulty procedure during the manufacturing of the motor vehicle, the maker can request to return either a batch or the entire production run. This procedure is called product recall. Product recalls happen in every industry and can be production-related or stem from the raw material.

Product and operation tests and inspections at different stages of the value chain are made to avoid these product recalls by ensuring end-user security and safety and compliance with the automotive industry requirements. However, the automotive industry is still particularly concerned about product recalls, which cause considerable financial consequences.

==Economy==

Around the world, there were about 806 million cars and light trucks on the road in 2007, consuming over  of gasoline and diesel fuel yearly. The automobile is a primary mode of transportation for many developed economies. The Detroit branch of Boston Consulting Group predicts that, by 2014, one-third of world demand will be in the four BRIC markets (Brazil, Russia, India and China). Other potentially powerful automotive markets are Iran and Indonesia.
Emerging auto markets already buy more cars than established markets. According to a J.D. Power study, emerging markets accounted for 51 percent of the global light-vehicle sales in 2010. The study expects this trend to accelerate.

==World motor vehicle production==

For many decades, the United States led the world in total automobile production. In 1929 before the Great Depression, the world had 32,028,500 automobiles in use, and the US automobile industry produced over 90% of them. At that time the U.S. had one car per 4.87 persons. After WWII the U.S. issued 3/4 of world's auto production. In 1980 the U.S. was overtaken by Japan and became world's leader again in 1994. In 2006, Japan narrowly passed the U.S. in production and held this rank until 2009, when China took the top spot with 13.8 million units. By producing 18.4 million units in 2011, China produced more than twice the number of automobiles made by the U.S. in second place with 8.7 million units, while Japan was in third place with 8.4 million units.

==Top vehicle manufacturing groups by volume==
The table below shows the world's largest motor vehicle manufacturing groups, along with the marques produced by each one. The table is ranked by 2011 end-of-year production figures from the International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers (OICA) for the parent group, and then alphabetically by marque. Joint ventures are not reflected in this table. Production figures of joint ventures are typically included in OICA rankings, which can become a source of controversy.

Note: This section does not include the selling of other products in a region; example: CAT sells commercial vehicles in the US, Canada, Mexico, Australia, and New Zealand, but sells its other products worldwide. If the table (markets) says that a brand is available in example North America, it doesn't include territories controlled by countries on other continents. Example: GMC isn't available in any European territories within North America. Depending on the situation between one country and another, that automotive brand may or may not be available in that certain country. Example: Because the United States and Iran do not have embassies with each other, automakers from both countries are not allowed to do business within the country, so Ford is available worldwide except Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Bhutan. Also if an automaker owns minority (less than 50%) or majority ownership of an automotive company from another country that established relationships with a country that its parent automaker with its headquarters in a country with no established relationship with that country, depending on the situation, the parent company may be forced to have the automotive company that it has practical ownership of to leave that country, if issued by the government of that country. While the parent company that has majority to fully owned ownership of a company from another country, that parent company is not allowed to have that company operate in that certain country. Example; General Motors has partial ownership in PSA Peugeot Citroen, and due to the situation with Iran, General Motors forced PSA Group to leave Iran. And General Motors has complete ownership of Opel and because of that, General Motors is not allowed to have the foreign company operate in countries the U.S. doesn't have an embassy with.

== By total production ==
Quantifying the total production of a manufacturer, from their start-up, is a difficult task, because of frequent company ownership changes.
However some producers, and independent sources, provide some valuable statistics:
* Toyota reached 200 000 000 vehicles as of July 2012 (after 77 years of production).

==Minor automotive manufacturers==

There are many automobile manufacturers other than the major global companies.  They are mostly regional or operating in niche markets.
