Trac is an open source, Web-based project management and bug tracking system. The program is inspired by CVSTrac, and was originally named svntrac due to its ability to interface with Subversion. It is developed and maintained by Edgewall Software.

Trac is written in the Python programming language. Until mid-2005, it was available under the GNU General Public License; since version 0.9, it has been released under a modified BSD license.

== Features ==
Trac allows hyperlinking information between a bug database, revision control and wiki content. It also serves as a Web interface to the following revision control systems: Subversion, Git, Mercurial, Bazaar, Perforce and Darcs. Prior to version 0.11, the web front end presentation of Trac was handled by the ClearSilver template system. Starting with 0.11, an in-house template system called Genshi is used, although compatibility with ClearSilver-based plugins will remain for several versions.

Other features include:

* Project management (Roadmap, Milestones, etc.)
* Ticket system (bug tracking, tasks, etc.)
* Fine-grained permissions (since 0.11)
* Timeline of all recent activity
* Wiki (syntax similar to MoinMoin)
* Customized reporting
* version control system Web interface
* RSS feeds
* Multiple project support (planned for post-1.0 versions)
* Environment extensibility (via Python plugins)
* iCalendar export
* Multiple repository Support per environment (since 0.12)
* Interface localizations (since 0.12)

== Adoption ==
Trac is reported to have more than 450 major installations worldwide.
Among the users of Trac are NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which reports that it uses this tool to manage various deep space and near space projects; Twisted, an asynchronous networking framework implemented in Python; the Dojo Toolkit, one of the popular Open source JavaScript library projects; Nginx, an open source Web server and a reverse proxy server; Piwik, a free software equivalent to services like Google Analytics; and WordPress, the popular blogging platform. They all use Trac for bug tracking and as a source tree viewer. Some projects also use Trac's wiki.
